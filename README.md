# Programming-laboratory

**Practical projects in C++ and Python focusing on templates, data structures, and applied algorithm design.**

---

This repository contains a series of projects developed during the *Programming Laboratory* course.  
The course emphasized hands-on application of programming principles through the use of templates, smart pointers, data serialization, hash tables, and dynamic structures.  
Python was introduced alongside C++ to compare interpreted and compiled paradigms and to promote versatility across languages.  
Key concepts include template specialization, STL containers, operator overloading, tree and graph structures, inheritance, and file I/O.  
Each project represents a practical exercise designed to apply and test theoretical knowledge through realistic programming challenges.  
All exercises are documented and structured for clarity, emphasizing correctness, performance, and reusability.
